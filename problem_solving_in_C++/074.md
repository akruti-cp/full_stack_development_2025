## 74.Write a function that simulates a simple login system. The user has 3 attempts to input the correct password. After 3 failed attempts, the function should print "Account locked."

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Function to simulate a login system with 3 attempts
void loginSystem() {
    // The correct password that the user must enter
    string correctPassword = "password123";  
    
    // Variable to store the entered password by the user
    string enteredPassword;  
    
    // Initialize the number of attempts to 3
    int attempts = 3;  

    // Loop that allows the user to input a password up to 3 times
    while (attempts > 0) {
        // Prompt the user to enter the password
        cout << "Enter password: ";
        
        // Read the entered password from the user
        cin >> enteredPassword;  

        // Check if the entered password matches the correct password
        if (enteredPassword == correctPassword) {
            // If the password is correct, print a success message
            cout << "Login successful!" << endl;
            
            // Exit the function since the login was successful
            return;  
        } else {
            // If the password is incorrect, decrease the number of attempts
            attempts--;  
            
            // Inform the user how many attempts are left
            cout << "Incorrect password. You have " << attempts << " attempts left." << endl;
        }
    }

    // If the loop exits, it means all attempts have been exhausted, so the account is locked
    cout << "Account locked." << endl;
}

int main() {
    // Call the login system function to begin the login process
    loginSystem();  

    // Return 0 to indicate the program executed successfully
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - The function gives the user up to 3 attempts to input the password. Each attempt involves a constant-time comparison and a small number of operations, making the total time complexity constant.

- **Explanation**:
  - The loop runs at most 3 times, and each iteration performs a constant number of operations (input, comparison, and output). Hence, the time complexity is constant \(O(1)\), as it does not depend on the size of any input but rather is determined by the fixed number of attempts.

### Space Complexity:

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - The space complexity is constant because the program only uses a fixed amount of memory for variables (`enteredPassword`, `correctPassword`, and `attempts`).
  
- **Explanation**:
  - The space used by the program does not grow with input size, as it only stores a few variables (the password and the number of attempts). Therefore, the space complexity is \(O(1)\).


### 2.Using Functions for Reusable Logic

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Function to validate the entered password
bool isPasswordCorrect(const string& enteredPassword) {
    string correctPassword = "password123";
    return enteredPassword == correctPassword;
}

// Function to handle login attempts
void loginSystem() {
    string enteredPassword;  // Variable to store the entered password
    int attempts = 3;  // Number of attempts

    // Loop for up to 3 attempts
    while (attempts > 0) {
        cout << "Enter password: ";
        cin >> enteredPassword;  // Get user input

        // Validate the password using the helper function
        if (isPasswordCorrect(enteredPassword)) {
            cout << "Login successful!" << endl;
            return;  // Exit the function if the password is correct
        } else {
            attempts--;  // Decrease the number of attempts left
            cout << "Incorrect password. You have " << attempts << " attempts left." << endl;
        }
    }

    // If all attempts are exhausted, lock the account
    cout << "Account locked." << endl;
}

int main() {
    loginSystem();  // Call the login system function
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`isPasswordCorrect` Function**: This helper function checks if the entered password matches the correct one.
- **`loginSystem` Function**: This function handles user input and tracks the number of attempts.

### 3. **Using a Flag to Indicate Lockout Status**

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Function to simulate a login system with a flag indicating lockout
void loginSystem() {
    string correctPassword = "password123";  // Set the correct password
    string enteredPassword;  // Variable to store the entered password
    int attempts = 3;  // Number of attempts
    bool isLocked = false;  // Flag to indicate if the account is locked

    // Loop to handle login attempts
    while (attempts > 0) {
        cout << "Enter password: ";
        cin >> enteredPassword;  // Get user input

        // Check if the password is correct
        if (enteredPassword == correctPassword) {
            cout << "Login successful!" << endl;
            return;  // Exit the function if login is successful
        } else {
            attempts--;  // Decrease the number of attempts left
            cout << "Incorrect password. You have " << attempts << " attempts left." << endl;
        }

        // Lock the account after 3 failed attempts
        if (attempts == 0) {
            isLocked = true;
            cout << "Account locked." << endl;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    loginSystem();  // Call the login system function
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`isLocked` Flag**: A boolean flag `isLocked` is used to keep track of whether the account has been locked. Itâ€™s set to `true` after 3 failed attempts.
- This approach can be extended to include lockout durations (e.g., locking the account for a specific period after 3 failed attempts).
