## 27. Write a program to extract the file extension from a given filename.Example: Input: "document.pdf", Output: "pdf".

### **Approach 1: Brute Force (Using String Manipulation)**
In this approach, we can manually check for the last period (`.`) in the filename and extract the substring that comes after it, which is the file extension.


### **Code Implementation for Brute Force Approach:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Function to extract the file extension from the filename
string getFileExtensionBruteForce(string filename) {
    // Find the position of the last period (.)
    int pos = filename.rfind('.');
    return filename.substr(pos + 1); 
}

int main() {
    string filename = "document.pdf";  // Example filename

    // Output the extracted file extension
    cout << "File Extension (Brute Force): " << getFileExtensionBruteForce(filename) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of Brute Force Approach:**
1. **Find the Last Period (`rfind`)**: We use the `rfind()` function to find the last occurrence of the period (`.`) in the filename. This helps in cases where there might be multiple periods in the filename.
2. **Check for Valid Period**: We check if the period is found (i.e., `rfind` doesn't return `string::npos`) and if it's not the first character of the string.
3. **Extract Substring**: If a valid period is found, we extract the substring starting from the character after the period using `substr(pos + 1)`.

### **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string. The `rfind()` function scans the string once to find the last period, and `substr()` also takes linear time to extract the substring.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(n)** for storing the substring (which is the file extension).

### **Approach 2: Easy Approach (Using `find_last_of` Method)**
In this approach, we use the `find_last_of()` method to find the last occurrence of a period (`.`) and extract the file extension in a more concise manner.

### **Code Implementation for Easy Approach:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Function to extract the file extension using find_last_of
string getFileExtensionEasy(string filename) {
    // Find the position of the last period (.)
    int pos = filename.find_last_of('.');
        // Extract and return the file extension
        return filename.substr(pos + 1);  // Substring after the period
    }
   
int main() {
    string filename = "document.pdf";  // Example filename

    // Output the extracted file extension
    cout << "File Extension (Easy Approach): " << getFileExtensionEasy(filename) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of Easy Approach:**
1. **`find_last_of()`**: This function is similar to `rfind()`, but it searches for any of the characters in the string argument. We pass `'.'` to find the last occurrence of the period.
2. **Check and Extract**: After finding the position of the period, we extract the substring after it (i.e., the file extension).

### **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string. Both `find_last_of()` and `substr()` take linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(n)** due to the storage of the substring (file extension).
